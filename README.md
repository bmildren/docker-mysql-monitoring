# MySQL Monitoring

Requires Docker 1.10+

MySQL monitoring example using docker-compose to orchestrate a monitoring solution using grafana, prometheus & influxdb.  It includes an example db node using mysql with a sample load generated by sysbench.  The prometheus config is manually configured in this example, although could be edited to use your preferred service discovery solution.  The prometheus configuration file can be found here: `./prometheus/config/prometheus.yml`, the config is imported into the container on startup.  When editing the prometheus configuration (to add/remove nodes, etc), you can restart the prometheus container individually to pick up the config changes.

The example will work with docker-machine however you will have to forward the grafana port (3000) to your localhost e.g. `ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 docker@$(docker-machine ip)` (_default boot2docker password == tcuser_).

cadvisor needs to mount filesystems from the host running the docker containers, the combination of docker-compose and docker-machine won't allow this, however a simple bash script is supplied `cadvisor_docker_machine.sh` which will stop the cadvisor container created by docker-compose and run one manually on the supplied docker-machine.

### Installation
* If you don't have it installed already, install docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* cd to monitor and run: `docker-compose up -d`
* To install an example db node with associated collectorsi, cd to example_dbnode and run: `docker-compose up -d`
* To install only the collecters using docker (not required for the example dbnode), cd to collecters and run: `docker-compose up -d`
* If you're running docker-machine use `cadvisor_docker_machine.sh` to relaunch the cadvisor container remotely

If you want to monitor other hosts edit the prometheus config file `./prometheus/config/prometheus.yml` add additional targets or your service discovery of choice, and restart prometheus, cd to monitor and run: `docker-compose restart prometheus`

```

Restart individual service
```
cd monitor
docker-compose restart prometheus
```

View mysqld log 
```
cd example_dbnode
docker-compose logs mysqld
```
